# NewsTube

**NewsTube** is a free and open-source application that transforms YouTube videos into a calm, readable digital newspaper by extracting and transcribing their content.

It is designed for people who want to practice **digital detox**, reduce visual overload, and consume information in a more intentional and mindful way.

Originally developed in Portuguese, NewsTube is built to help people — not to capture attention.

## 🌱 Philosophy

Modern video platforms are optimized for engagement, not reflection.  
NewsTube offers a different approach to online information:

- Read instead of watch  
- Reflect instead of scroll  
- Choose content intentionally  
- Reduce cognitive and emotional overload  

The project is **non-commercial**, **ad-free**, **privacy-respecting**, and **free forever**.

NewsTube exists solely as a tool to support healthier information consumption.
